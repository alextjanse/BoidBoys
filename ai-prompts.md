# BlazorApp
Used to generate the page and UI for the blazor app.
## Prompt
I want to create a blazor app to do the UI for a boid simulation. There should be input for the number of boids and boid parameters and there should be an info view with FPS counter and other statistics. The simulation will be rendered in ThreeJS, prepare a frame for that as well. On input change, the simulation should reset with the new parameters.
